# Weather

Here is some of the work I have done using HTML,CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Bootstrap and JQuery. Its this cool weather app brilliantly named "Barry's Weather App!" that collects a 3 day weather summary from a weather site and presents it to the user. Check it out...https://barry-ire7.000webhostapp.com/ (I haven't bought the domain yet). Code files are also attached above if you want to check the code out.

Also if you want to check out another site im completing for a football team... http://s608170030.websitehome.co.uk/ its pretty cool and in development at the moment. I started this in WordPress which I have just started to learn about, very easy platform with the plugins and themes. Im getting to learn more about SEO, child themes and enqueueing with it, which is cool. Im planning on continuing on working with St Nicks using WordPress and also working on my local football clubs site as they could do with an update too. 

This might be too much, but ill show you anyway, im proud of all this!

Really I was just learning with this. It runs code in the browser, has the obvious security issues, so running JavaScript is commented out, the code files are attached above, if you want to take a look.

I've checked and re-checked that the links open and are all working, but any problems let me know!
